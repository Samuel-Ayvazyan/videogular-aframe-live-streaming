# VideogularAframe

This project is a showcase of Videogular2 player with Aframe and HLS (HTTP Live streaming)

## Showcase

This is good example for developers who would like to have 360 Video player on their Angular 6 web application.

## Issues which we would like to show and find solutions

1. AFrame issue - Example with AFrame not working on iOS11 - Player is working, but no picture. The same player working with picture without Aframe.
2. Videogular issue - We are getting this error only for pages where we have Videogular2
ERROR Error: Uncaught (in promise): Event: {"isTrusted":true}
